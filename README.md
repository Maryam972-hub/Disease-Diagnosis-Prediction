# Disease-Diagnosis-Prediction
This notebook focuses on building a machine learning model to assist in predicting the presence or absence of a disease based on patient data. It works with a structured dataset that includes various health-related features such as symptoms, test results, and medical history indicators. The aim is to train a predictive model that can offer a reliable diagnosis suggestion, potentially supporting healthcare professionals in early detection and treatment planning.

The workflow begins with data preprocessing, where the dataset is cleaned and formatted to ensure consistency. This involves handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and preparing the feature set for model training. After preparing the data, a quick analysis helps to reveal any useful trends or correlations that could influence the prediction.

Once the data is ready, machine learning algorithms are applied to classify whether a patient is likely to have the disease. The notebook experiments with different models and evaluates their performance using standard classification metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall. The results are then interpreted to assess the practical usefulness of the model.

This project demonstrates how data science techniques can be applied in the medical field to support diagnosis tasks. While itâ€™s not a replacement for professional medical judgment, it highlights the potential of machine learning to serve as a supportive tool in the healthcare decision-making process.
